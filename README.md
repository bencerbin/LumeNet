# LumeNet
LumeNet is an AI-powered image restoration tool that uses deep learning to automatically colorize black-and-white photos. Leveraging convolutional neural networks, the system performs context-aware, realistic color reconstruction with potential applications in history, media, and art.

Having started as an unrealized project proposal in my Neural Networks class, LumeNet has developed to support full restoration of black-and-white photos via a Gradio interface.
